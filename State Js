State:
In react,state is like a container that holds the data or information for a component.
This data can be change over time based on user actions or events
Why state is important in react:
--it allows us the component to remember things.
Ex: if you click a button to change a color; the state will store hold the color and show on the screen.
1)	Fuctional components:
   Syntax:
Const[stateVariable,setstatefunction]=useState(initialvalue)
1)statevariable: holds the current state(ex:name,color)
2)setstatefunction: A function which is used to update the state
3) initial Value: The initial value of a state variable when the component first renders.
