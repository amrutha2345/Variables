You are tasked with building a system to check whether a person is eligible to vote. The system follows these rules:
1.	A person must be at least 18 years old to vote
2.	If the person is a citizen, they are eligible to vote.
3.	If the person is not a citizen but has passed a citizenship test, they are eligible to vote.
4.	If the person is under 18, they cannot vote.
Voting eligible :
<script>
            let i=parseInt(prompt("Enter your age"));
            let j=prompt("Do you have citizen ship? yes or no");
            if(i<18){
                console.log("You are not eligible for voting");
            }
            else if(i>=18 && j=="yes"){
                console.log("You are eligible for voting");
            
            }
            else if(i>=18 && j=="no"){
                console.log("You are eligible for voting");
            }
            else{
                console.log("Invalid input");
            }
    </script>

            if (amountSpent > 100) {
                discount = 20;
            } else if (amountSpent > 50 && amountSpent <= 100) {
                discount = 10;
            }
            if (isPremiumMember.toLowerCase() === "yes") {
                discount += 5;
            }
            let finalAmount = amountSpent - (amountSpent * discount / 100);
            document.write("Total discount: " + discount + "%<br>");
